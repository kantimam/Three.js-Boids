# Three.js-Boids
Three.js Boids in 3d and 2d space.  
Watch or fly around with a swarm of angry cones.  
Tweak settings to create your behavior or maybe add your own mesh to make a swarm of something nicer.   

# Usage
git clone https://github.com/kantimam/Three.js-Boids.git  
serve index.html with your local server of choice. 

# Warning
default values for 2d boids are somewhat horrible.
Just double all the distances and forces to get more action

# TODO
Speed of free camera equals the boids speed wich is fine for low speeds but impossible to handle when you increase it to much.
Maybe add slider for camera movement speed.  
  
Default values for 2d boids are kinda horrible usually way to low.  
Maybe create 2 different sets of default values for 2d and 3d
