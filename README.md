# Three.js-Boids
Three.js Boids in 3d and 2d space.
Watch or fly around with a swarm of angry cones.
Tweak settings to create your behavior or maybe add your own mesh to make a swarm of of something nicer. 

# Usage
git clone https://github.com/kantimam/Three.js-Boids.git
serve index.html with your local server of choice. 

# TODO
2d mode only partially implemented. 

Fix homeDist values.

Speed of free camera equals the boids speed wich is fine for low speeds but impossible to handle when you increase it to much.
Maybe add slider for camera movement speed.
